Project for getting my Bachelor Degree.

Assignement: Create a Javascript Library for parsing data from Yahoo Pipes. This data can be inserted and filtered in Yahoo Pipes. Afterwards the output needs to serve as input data for a Visualisation library like Google Chart or d3.js (previously Protoviz.)

More information will be added soon.
